Problem Identification : Given an array of size N, find ALL/LONGEST SUBARRAY that meets certain CONDITION


DEFINE : subarray condition to be met for answer to be feasible

left = 0,right = 0

for(right = 0; right < n; right++):(slide right boundary)
    update window with element at right pointer
    while (subarray condition is violated):
        remove element at left pointer from window, move left pointer to the right(slide left boundary)
    record answer for subarry [left, left + 1, ..... right - 1, right](Number of elements = right - left + 1)

NOTE : When the entire subarray [left..right] violates the subarray condition then left becomes equal to right + 1 and Number of elements = (right - (right + 1) +1) = 0 which is true. Therefore, the algorithm is consitent with this corner case.
