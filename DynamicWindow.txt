define subarray condition to be met for answer to be feasible

left = 0,right = 0

for(right = 0; right < n; right++):(slide right boundary)
    update window with element at right pointer
    while (subarray condition is violated):
        remove element at left pointer from window, move left pointer to the right(slide left boundary)
    record answer for subarry [left, left + 1, ..... right - 1, right]
