Problem Identification : Given an array of size N, find computation on EVERY SUBARRAY OF FIXED SIZE K.

Let the window be denoted by two pointers-endWindow and startWindow.
Initial State : 
startWindow = endWindow = 0
Size of the window at any instant = endWindow - startWindow + 1

while(endWindow < n)//Perform operation till the last window
{
	add arr[endWindow] to the current answer

        //Window Size hit
	if(endWindow - startWindow + 1 == k)
	{
		//Perform required computation on the required window [startWindow, startWindow + 1, ..., endWindow]

		//Remove the first entry from the current window before sliding

		startWindow++;
	}
  	++endWindow
}
